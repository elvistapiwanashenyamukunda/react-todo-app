React + TypeScript To-Do App

A simple "single-page To-Do application" built with React + TypeScript.  
This project demonstrates component design, state management, mock API integration, and clean UX with loading & error states.

## Features

1. Display a list of To-Do items (title, description, checkbox for completion)  
2. Add a new To-Do using a form  
3. Edit an existing To-Do via modal  
4. Mark as complete / incomplete  
5. Delete a To-Do  
6. Mock API integration (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with simulated latency  
7. Loading indicators and error messages  
8. Responsive design for desktop & mobile  
9. Strict TypeScript typing (no `any`)  


## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast bundling
- Mock REST API (simulated with `setTimeout`)
- Plain CSS (easily swappable with Tailwind)
